	7zUI - Graphical interface for 7-Zip archives

7zUI is a simple MUI Interface to decompresses 7-Zip archives, created using 
the latest LZMA SDK by Igor Pavlov.

Features:

 - 100% AmigaOS Native (no ixemul crap)
 - Fastest as possible atm...
 - Reasonable memory required
 - easy to use :)

Limitations:

 - only able to extract archives (no creation)
 - extracts single coder and packet stream archives only *


There are two modes for launching the tool, like a normal MUI program or just
from CLI given the required arguments, if you give any cli arguments the MUI
Interface will not be created and just will do what you instruct to do, list
the archive, test the integrity, or extract it.
